# odin-basic-node-site

Created a basic Node.js website without any frameworks as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site). The site switches between a few different html pages or a 404 page depending on the url sent to the server.
Used nodemon to not have to restart the server after every change.
